  <h1> Diving Into The Word of Responsive Web <h1>

<h3> What is RWD anyways? <h3>
<div class="box1">
  <p> Some say responsive web is a must to make your website looks its
    absolute best on any platform. I say it's your best bet
  to keep your web visitors from saying "Ughh" when your boxs don't
    their screen.

<div class="box2>"
  <p> you must adapt to survive without adapting you will get left behind and
    web visitors will go somewhere else somewhere more visually appealing and
    user friendly <p>
</div>
<div class="box3"
    <p> Wether you use a 4" iphone4 or an 8" samsung galaxy tab or your playing
      around on your computer each website you visit has to adapt <p>
