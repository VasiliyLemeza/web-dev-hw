            <h3> Dirt on My Boots<h3/>
              <h2> by. Jon Pardi<h2/>
                <p>Been up since the crack of dawn
Just trying to paid
Been hotter than a hundred suns
I can't find no shade
Just two more roads and I'm good to go
Yeah, I'm shutting this tractor down
Get me a half an hour for a shave and a shower
And I'll be outside your house<p/><p>
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you're up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight (yeah, girl)
Got a little dirt on my boots<p/>
