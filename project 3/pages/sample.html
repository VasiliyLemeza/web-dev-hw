  <p class="sansserif">   They brought out the Knot and hung it from the flagpole. They brought
    out the official square wooden table for the challenger to stand on, and
    from the moment Maniac climbed up, you could tell the Knot was in big
    trouble.</p>
  <p class="sansserif">  To the ordinary person, Cobble's Knot was about as friendly as a
     nest of yellow jackets. Besides the tangle itself, there was the weathering
     of that first year, when the Knot hung outside and became hard as a rock. You
     could barely make out the individual strands. It was grimy, moldy, crusted
     over. Here and there a loop stuck out, maybe big enough to stick your pinky
     finger through, pitiful testimony to the challengers who had tried and failed.
