  <p class="sansserif"> I can't even recall why I picked this book up
  so many years ago. Was most likely forced by my grade school teacher,
   but I am sure glad I did because I don't think i'll
ever forget it. Almost two decades later and I can still remember
parts of the book that had a big impact on me, enough to engrave them
into my mind</p>

<p><i>"One of the best books ever for upper elementary and middle school kids!
   Great lessons on treating others the same and getting along with people
    who are different."</i></p>

<p><i>"I loved this book as a child and nothing has changed. I still find it a great book.""
